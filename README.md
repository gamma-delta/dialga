# dialga

A sister crate to Palkia, adding Caves of Qud-like data-driven blueprints.

## The `Ctx` Generic

A lot of things in this library have a `Ctx` generic. This is for ... well,
whatever you want!

For example, you might want to be able to spawn enemies with varying (random)
hit points. So the `Ctx` type might have a RNG in it, for example... go wild.

The "documentation" for this crate is mostly the examples directory.
Go check that out I guess.
